## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

### Examples
```text
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.

## 💻 Implementation (Java)

```java
/**
 * Intitution :  
 * Time : O(logN)
 * Space : O(1)
 */
class Solution {
    public int findCeil(int[] arr, int x) {

        int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = -1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] >= x) {
                ans = mid;
                r= mid-1;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
