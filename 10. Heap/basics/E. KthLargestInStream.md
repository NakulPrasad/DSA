# [Kth Largest Element in Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/description/)

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

Implement the KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

```
Example 1:

Input:
["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]

Output: [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
```

```java
class KthLargest {
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    int n;
    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.n=k;
        Arrays.stream(nums).forEach(minHeap::add);

    }

    public int add(int val) {
        minHeap.add(val);
        while(minHeap.size() > n){
            minHeap.poll();
        }
        return minHeap.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * KthLargest obj = new KthLargest(k, nums);
 * int param_1 = obj.add(val);
 */
```
